### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
All of the main functionality for my pages and features are complete, I am just working on final testing. I also began to work on documenting my code and adding some small non-breaking, minor changes with the extra time I have. All these tasks are managable before the deadline.

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle
  * Testing
  * Documentation
  * Audit Log Stuff
  * Final Report
  * Cleanup

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
File upload for workday and sei is complete. I am now working on, and will continue to work on in the last cycle, two more csv import features. I also have a solid foundation for my help pages and will add other topics as necessary. Documentation and testing are going to be targeted as soon as my functionality is complete. 

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle
  * Testing
  * Ta Assign (csv)
  * Course Assign (csv)

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
The file upload functionality for the workday and sei data is complete, including the changes made to fit the requirements (calculating dropped and confirm overwrite courses). I will now be focusing on the ta assignment functionality which will include manual and csv assignment. I should be able to reference my other code which uses a similar structure. Everything is on track and I aim to complete these features this upcoming cycle.

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle
  * Testing
  * Ta Assign (manual)
  * Ta Assign (csv)
  * Ta Rating

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
I added some extra feature to the manual import page (adding and deleting multple rows). I just have to figure out a UI for those features. I also completed a big chunk of the file upload functionality. It can read from the files and populate a form, I just need to work on validating the data to prevent errors and then sending that data to the db. I will then work on UI and testing to complete the import feature completely.

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle
  * Upload file UI
  * Upload file functionality
  * Populate form from pulled data
  * Submit populated form to db

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
All CSV files can now be read from and the data structured appropriately. I am just working on validation to minimize errors when inserting data. Once that is complete, most of the feature will be done as I already have a templete I can use for the SEI upload file page. I plan to complete these tasks within the next couple of days and focus on testing for the next cycle. 

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle
  * Populate sei form from pulled data
  * Validate data (frontend, backend, db)
  * Submit populated form to db
  * Delete rows
  * Testing

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
I polished up necessary UI changes to the import pages and ensure that the functionality still works. I continued to work on the file upload function although the changes are still on my local machine. Finally, I helped with creating the task list for the testing event and the google survey for feedback.

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
I updated all the import page UI to be more unified with the rest of the application. I also began to work on the file upload functionality. I am having to rework some of the routing, but so far I am able to upload multiple files and pull the necessary data from them. Next step to is to either insert that into the database or populate a input form with the found data.

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle
  * Fix routing
  * Upload file UI
  * Populate form from pulled data

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
I wasn't feeling great this cycle, so I decided to take it easy. I started a couple of smaller tasks and completed some UI validation on the sei import page which will increase user experience. We are all working on our assigned tasks, so I plan to continue down the checklist in the coming cycles. I finished my basic testing which covers rendering, inserting data, and validation. These should be good for the import page for now and I will add more later if necessary.

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle
  * Small UI changes
  * Add extra validation (both for UI and database)
  * Extra functionality for inserting data (copy row, mass delete, mass add)
  * Upload file functionality

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
Now that MVP is complete, we are working to really focus on testing our pages fully to ensure a solid system is in place. We will also now focus on some of the extra functionality planned, like gamification, and adding extra functionlaity to pages that may be helpful to users.

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle
  * Testing for my pages
  * Small UI changes and extra functionality

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
Finished everything I was assigned and am preparing for the MVP presentation and milestone deadline. Since my unit tests are not complete for the MVP, I am doing thourough manual testing to ensure that everything will work smoothly on the day. We have integrated everyone's parts into the existing system and should be ready for MVP.

  * Write the functions to calculate course enrollment averages
  * Testing for my pages

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
Finished the import page and now working on the assigning courses to instructors page. The minimum functionality is complete and would be ready for the MVP, however I would like to polish it up a bit. I am also in the process of creating functions to average some of the performance data and store it in other tables.

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
The core functionality of the import page is complete. The UI needs updating to match rest of system which I will work on next cycle. We began to integrate the import page with the course details page and both features are running on the same branch which is a great step. The rest of the items for this features are smaller, polishing, tasks.

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
I am still working the import page feature. I have decided to make the switch to livewire components which will help with rendering dynamic UI elements. Most of the functionality is working with the traditional controller, I just need to make the conversion. We had a long meeting on Wednesday which was really helpful to understand how our features work together.

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * Refining current functionality
  * Adding data to database
  * Add manual import functionlity
  * Configure CSV file structure for import to work

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
I am working on completing my assigned page features (Import). I have broken down the page into smaller tasks / issues and working through them step by step. Sometimes looking at a big feature can be intimidating or I am not sure where to start. I have found that making a personal todo list of really small tasks helps alot with the process.

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
We spent a lot of time working on environment setup, but we eventually got the system to run on every member's machine. We have now assigned some small issues and features to people to get us started on the development. We are also preparing for the presentation this week. I have been working on compiling the dashboard components, extracted by another member.

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * Complete the Dashboard

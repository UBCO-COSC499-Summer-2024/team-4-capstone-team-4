### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
The core functionality of the import page is complete. The UI needs updating to match rest of system which I will work on next cycle. We began to integrate the import page with the course details page and both features are running on the same branch which is a great step. The rest of the items for this features are smaller, polishing, tasks.

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle
  * Converse with team about UI
  * Add column for year to distinguish unique courses
  * Testing

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
Working to polish up the import page. The main functionality is complete for MVP and am looking to integrate it with the existing system. Will also want to discuss UI for a more permanent design. 

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle
  * Test functionality / feature
  * Integrate features with rest of system

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
I am still working the import page feature. I have decided to make the switch to livewire components which will help with rendering dynamic UI elements. Most of the functionality is working with the traditional controller, I just need to make the conversion. We had a long meeting on Wednesday which was really helpful to understand how our features work together.

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * Refining current functionality
  * Adding data to database
  * Add manual import functionlity
  * Configure CSV file structure for import to work

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
I am working on completing my assigned page features (Import). I have broken down the page into smaller tasks / issues and working through them step by step. Sometimes looking at a big feature can be intimidating or I am not sure where to start. I have found that making a personal todo list of really small tasks helps alot with the process.

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * Refining current functionality
  * Adding data to database
  * Debugging

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * Breaking down features into tasks
  * Continue integrating componenets

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
We spent a lot of time working on environment setup, but we eventually got the system to run on every member's machine. We have now assigned some small issues and features to people to get us started on the development. We are also preparing for the presentation this week. I have been working on compiling the dashboard components, extracted by another member.

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * Complete the Dashboard
  * Aquire new feature assignment

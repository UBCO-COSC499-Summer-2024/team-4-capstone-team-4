### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
We spent a lot of time working on environment setup, but we eventually got the system to run on every member's machine. We have now assigned some small issues and features to people to get us started on the development. We are also preparing for the presentation this week. I have been working on compiling the dashboard components, extracted by another member.

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * Complete the Dashboard
  * Aquire new feature assignment

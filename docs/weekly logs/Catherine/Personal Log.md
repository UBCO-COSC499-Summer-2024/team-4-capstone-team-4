### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
I have finished sorting for all the columns in the staff table and I am working on adding, editing and removing target hours. I'm having some issues with ajax. Setting up DroneCI also isn't done as expected so hopefully it will be completed by next cycle. I haven't written test yet but have done manual testing.

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * Finishing setting up DroneCI
  * Finish adding, editing and removing
  * Write tests

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
I have pulled data from the database for all the columns in staff list. We changed the way we get the subarea from the database so I've been finding it hard to correctly pull the data, especailly for filtering and that been taking longer than expected.

I worked on creating the staff page where I completed the staff list component and search function by first name as well sorting for name column. I have partially pulled data from the database.

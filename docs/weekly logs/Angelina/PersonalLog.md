### Current Tasks 
  * #1: Debug Chart.JS issues
  * #2: Continue Integration of Progress Bar Plugin
  * #3: Improve Dashboard Containers
  * #4: Change Environment to Linux for faster navigation

### Progress Update 
| **TASK/ISSUE #**          | **STATUS**  |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| Debug Chart.JS Issues     | Completed   |
| Progress Bar Plugin       | In Progress |
| Improve Containers        | In Progress |
| Move to Linux             | Completed   |


### Cycle Goal Review 
Began debugging Chart.JS and worked with Clement to move my environment to linux so that the pages loaded faster as the slow rendering was hindering my chart testing process. This environment change proved to be more complicated than expected, and we encountered hurdles such as long download and updating time, needing to reinstall docker, conflicting index.html files, reconfiguring php, and other extension confiuration related errors. This process took the majority of our project meeting. Debugging Cahrt.JS also took some time, as the plugin setup caused the charts to no longer appear. Upon reintegrating CHart.JS, I have decided using a plugin for the progress bar may be overkill and unnecessary, and my time would be more valuably spent working on all of the dashboard components.

### Next Cycle Goals 
  * Find a new way to display a progress bar without a custom plugin
  * Continue improving the container structure of the dashboard
  * Add leaderboard to dashboard frontend
  * Connect database to charts
  * Create charts for the department dashboard

| Dashboard Instructor List | Completed   |
| Progress Bar Plugin       | In Progress |


### Cycle Goal Review 
Finished updating the chart controller to display a chart relevant to our data and began formatting the dashboard containers. Began adding a second chart to display the progress bar, and started to create a plugin for said chart. Added lists for service roles, course sections, and extra hours to the dashboard, and formatted them appropriately for the project vision. Creating the progress bar plugin proved more difficult than expected, and setting up Chart.JS proved to be a bit of a learning curve. I have not done much front end design for web pages either, so I am working to become more familiar with the container structue. More research was necessary this week than in other parts of the project, but progress is still evident.

### Next Cycle Goals 
  * Contiune configuring progress bar plugin
  * Finalize chart controller and connect to database
  * Finish creating containers for all dashboard items, and submit to group for review

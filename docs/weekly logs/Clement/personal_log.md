### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)

This cycle was primarily dedicated to tackling a list of feature requests. Significant progress was made, with the majority of requests successfully implemented. Notable accomplishments include improvements to service role visibility, approvals functionality, audit logging, and UI enhancements. 

One feature request regarding auto-filters display was cancelled, and the task of aligning confirmation modals with the desired design has been moved to the next cycle due to time constraints. 

The implementation of the Export PDF feature has been shifted to the next cycle to allow for dedicated focus.

Overall, the process is progressing efficiently, and the team is effectively addressing user feedback and refining the application's functionality. 


### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
* Finish implementing remaining feature requests.
* **Prioritize changing confirmation modals to match the new design standards.**
* **Complete the implementation of the Export PDF feature.**
* Conduct thorough testing of all implemented features. 
* Begin work on any new high-priority tasks.

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)

This cycle was highly productive with a balance of finalizing features and laying the groundwork for new ones. Resolving the Browsershot errors to deliver the PDF export feature is still underway. The Audit Log and Service Role Import functionalities were also completed this cycle.

Significant progress was made on the Service Requests/Approvals feature, including foundational elements like unit tests, seeders, factories, and initial front-end design. Additionally, code optimization and refinement were done on global elements like the header and CSS styling. 

Testing for the Service Role Page and gathering feedback through peer reviews remain ongoing tasks.

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
* Complete testing for the Service Role Page
* Conduct peer testing and gather feedback
* Continue working on getting the PDF exporting working
* Apply any necessary fixes and improvements based on feedback
* **Continue front-end development for the Service Requests/Approvals feature**
* **Progress development and testing of the approval functionality**
* Begin implementation of remaining high-priority project requirements

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)

This cycle was very productive with substantial progress made on both the Service Role and Help Page features. 

The Help Page functionality is now complete, including core features, search capabilities, and media support. Peer testing feedback was addressed and necessary fixes implemented, enhancing the user experience. 

Work continues on finalizing the PDF export for Service Roles, with the primary focus remaining on resolving the persistent Browsershot errors.

Testing of the Service Role page is ongoing. 

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)

This cycle focused heavily on improving the Service Role management features. 
A new PDF export design was implemented and optimized, along with a preview route and button for easier review. 
Dark Mode functionality was completed, and a "stay on page" option was added after saving changes. 
Tooltips were incorporated for better usability, and validation for Service Role pages was improved.
The Add Service Role page received a redesign for a more streamlined experience.

Testing of the Service Role page is ongoing, and peer testing will be conducted in the next cycle to gather feedback. 

The biggest challenge this cycle was resolving fatal errors encountered with Browsershot while finalizing the PDF export functionality.  While a complete solution is still in progress, significant progress has been made and a resolution is close.

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
 * Complete testing for the Service Role Page
 * Apply any necessary fixes and improvements based on feedback
 * Continue implementation of remaining project requirements

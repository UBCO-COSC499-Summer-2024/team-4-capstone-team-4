### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
I completed the design documentation and mockups as planned. However, the environment setup (Laravel and Docker) is taking longer than expected due to some configuration issues.

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * Complete Laravel setup
  * Complete Docker setup
  * Begin integrating backend with frontend

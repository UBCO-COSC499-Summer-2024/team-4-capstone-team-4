### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
The cycle was productive with significant progress made on various tasks including environment setup, component implementations, and personal logs update. However, some tasks like planning assigned features and Docker optimization are still ongoing.

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * Complete planning of assigned features and tasks
  * Finalize Docker optimization
  * Continue refining UI components
